This repository contains the following: 
- `functions.R` file with all the functions used  
- `.qmd` files for all three analysed countries (Belarus, the USA and Czechia) 
- `data-input` directory, with data for the analysis 
- `fig` directory contains the created outputs of the analysis (.pdf figures)
- `outputs` directory contains exported tables (.csv files)
- `config.yml` file with the repository setup
